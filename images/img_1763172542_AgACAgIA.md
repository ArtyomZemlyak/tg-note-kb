Figure 2. Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg): Given some arbitrary input data with density ру with support that may or may not lie on a manifold (left), a Deep network (DN) encoder ( fg) produces embeddings z = fg(x) with some distribution 2 ~ р. (middle). Our proposed Backward Crameér-Wold Statistics (Section 4) objective pushes р: to match a target distribution р; by projecting the embeddings along 14 directions (middle, arrows) and enforcing that the univariate densities (right, colored lines) match the distribution of p;, projected along the same directions. Any popular statistical test (provided in Section 4.2) can assess the goodness-of-fit-in practice we argue for characteristic function tests (Section 4.2). by using SiGReg with р; isotropic Gaussian (right, black lines), we introduce a lean and provably optimal (Section 3) JEPA, coined LeJEPA, free of numerous heuristics and able to produce competitive performances (Sections 5 and 6).
