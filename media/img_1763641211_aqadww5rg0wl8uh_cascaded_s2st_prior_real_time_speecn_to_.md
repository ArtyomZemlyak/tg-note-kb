## Cascaded S2ST

Prior real-time speecn-to-speech tecnnologies employed a cascaded pipeline of individual processing DIocks:

1. Firstly, the source audio 15 transcribed to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) Al models.
2. Next, the transcribed text is translated word-tor-word to the target language using automatic speech translation (AST).
3. Finally, the translated text is converted back to audio using text-to-speech pipelines (TTS).

Schematic representation of classic, cascade-style speech-to-speech translation system.

Despite the nigh quality of the individual Cascade components, achieving a seamless, real-time 525Т experience nas been challenging due to three primary factors:

1. Significant delays of 4—5 seconds, forcing turn-based conversations.
2. Accumulated errors at each stage of the translation process.
3. А notable lack of personalization due to the general-purpose TTS tecnnology.
