## Extracted Text (OCR)

Proposition 2 (Complex-to-Real SSM Equivalence). Consider a complex-valued SSM

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where h(t) € C'/?, @(t),B(t),B(t),C(t),C(t) € RX/2, and x(t), A(t) ЕВ. Under Euler discretization, this system is equivalent to a real-valued SSM

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

with state hy; Е ВА, projections

and a transition matrix
