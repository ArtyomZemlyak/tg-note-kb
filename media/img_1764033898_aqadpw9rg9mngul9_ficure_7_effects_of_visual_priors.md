## Extracted Text (OCR)

Ficure 7. Effects of visual priors in VARC. Accuracy 15 reported on the ARC -] evaluation set. [The model used is Vil-lI&amp;M. Entries (a-c) use a patch size of 1x1 on a 52X52 Canvas, whereas entries (d-f) use a patch size of 2x2 on a 64х64 canvas. Each entry modifies the one above it. We start from a naive baseline with components (b-T) removed. [hese vision priors cumulatively yield 2/./ improvement (a—&gt;fT), 11 which the canvas-based designs (c—&gt;f) contribute an 11.5 gain.
