## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 2: (a) Relative speed of our method, EGGROLL, in terms of experience throughput versus prior methods, where [00 represents the maximum batch throughput of pure inference. See Appendix Е for more details. (b) We use EGGROLL to train RNN language models from scratch using only integer datatypes, scaling population size from 64 to 262144.
