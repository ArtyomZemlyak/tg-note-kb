## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 4 | Omni-modal captions generation pipeline. Video is segmented into 20-second clips. Visual and audio captions are generated independently for each segment, but lack cross-modal context and contain wrong understanding (modality-specific hallucination). A separate LLM performs cross-modal correction and summarization to create accurate omni-modal captions.
