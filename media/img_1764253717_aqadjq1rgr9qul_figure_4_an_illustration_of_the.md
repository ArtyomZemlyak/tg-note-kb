## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 4. An illustration of the proposed Step by Step Network. For simplicity, the shortcut 1n each residual block 1s omitted. (a) Width-depth trade-off. When enlarging the depth of a residual model, the width has to be reduced to maintain similar computation. In contrast, StepsNet makes it possible for the model! to be deeper with fixed width and computation. (b) [he 2-step network. Given ап input « € В^ ХС, the model first splits the information into two parts x71, x2 along the channel dimension С'. Subsequently, 2:1 and хо are processed sequentially by two networks /; and Ло, generating the final output yo. (©) [he n-step network. Kepeatedly substituting the first network with a 2-step architecture creates an n-step network, which divides x into п parts and processes them progressively.
