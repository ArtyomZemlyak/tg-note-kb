## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 1: Responses to the query **Write a metaphor about time" clustered by applying PCA to reduce sentence embeddings to two dimensions. Each of the 25 models generates 50 responses using top-p sampling (p = 0.9) and temperature = 1.0. Despite the diversity of model families and sizes, the responses form just two primary clusters: a dominant cluster on the left centered on the metaphor "time 1$ a river,' and a smaller cluster on the right revolving around variations of "time 1$ a weaver."
