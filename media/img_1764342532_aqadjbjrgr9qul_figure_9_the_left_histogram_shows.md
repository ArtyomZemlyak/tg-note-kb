## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 9: The left histogram shows the distribution of Shannon Entropy computed over the 25 human ratings for each (Query, Response) pair. Given the open-ended nature of the queries, multiple responses can be valid, leading to diverse preferences across annotators. As a result, the annotation label distributions vary significantly across examples. The middle panel presents representative (Query, Response) pairs from different entropy regions, and the right bar plots display their corresponding label distributions.
