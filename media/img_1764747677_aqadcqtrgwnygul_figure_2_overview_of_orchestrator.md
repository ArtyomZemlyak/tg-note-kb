## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 2 | Overview of Orchestrator. Given a task, Orchestrator alternates between reasoning and tool calling in multiple turns to solve it. Orchestrator interacts with a diverse tool set, including basic tools (web search, functions such as get\_flight\_status, etc.), specialized LLMs (coding models, math models, etc.) and generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, etc.). In training under ToolOrchestra, Orchestrator is jointly optimized by outcome, efhiciency and preference rewards via reintorcement, learning.
