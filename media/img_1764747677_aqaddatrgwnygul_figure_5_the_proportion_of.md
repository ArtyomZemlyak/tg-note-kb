## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 5 | The proportion of tool calls made by LLMs to solve a task (averaged across HLE, Frames and T*-bench). Qwen-32B refers to Qwen3-32B [27] and Coder-32B refers to Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct [24]. Compared to other strong foundation models, Orchestrator-8B makes more balanced tool calls, and does not exhibit strong biases toward a particular tool or model. Detailed statistics are shown in Table 15.
