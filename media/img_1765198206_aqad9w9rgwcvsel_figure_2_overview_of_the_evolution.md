## Extracted Text (OCR)

Figure 2. Overview of the evolution of code large language models (Code-LLMs) and related ecosystems from 2021 to 2025. The landscape begins with early models and quickly expands into a diverse set of LLM coders across 2022-2024. From 2025 onward, research focus shifts toward reinforcement learning (КГ.)-Базеа training, software engineering (SWE) agents, and novel architectures such as diffusion-based code models. In parallel, a rich ecosystem of terminal tools, IDE integrations, and plugins emerges, highlighting the transition from pure modeling to practical developer-oriented applications.
